# 656 Div. 3

## Three Pairwise Maximums

This is a bit of an arbitrary problem. You have: 

* x = max(a,b)
* y = max(a,c)
* z = max(b,c)

That means essentially that one of these numbers is repeated (because if we
don't have a repeated number, then one of them is not the max of one of the
pairs).

Implemented in C++ and Python. And now in Golang.
